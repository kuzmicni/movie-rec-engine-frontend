# movie-rec-engine-frontend

Here you can find the Movie Recommendation engine Vue.js frontend code. 

I created this project to leverage the open-source [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and hopefully help people figure out what to watch next. Below is an illustration of what the engine will recommend if you enter the movie "Heat (1995)". You can also try it out based on your favourite movie on: [mynextmovie.ca](https://mynextmovie.ca)

## Get started

Before building out the frontend, you will need to make sure that the backend API is running in the background and will serve the movie recommendations. On the instructions how to do that please refer to:
